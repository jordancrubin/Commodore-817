# Commodore-817
This is the complete collection of assembly code for the Commodore 817 - FT817 RS232 interface for the commodore 64

The code is designed to be compiled with 64Tass compiler or one of that style.  
Note that the initial file commodore-817.prg is written in such a way that the resulting prg will
record data between 0C00 through the areas starting at C000.  This will result in a large output file
that can easily be crunched. Exomizer was used during the development of this program.

./exomizer -s0xC000 -o ~/output/commodore-817.prg commodore-817.prg

With the exception of commodore-817.prg, the resulting output prg files must all be capitalized. before or after moving to a disk image.

commodore-817.prg
MAIN.prg                                          
HELP.prg                                          
STARTUPCHK.PRG                                    
TCALCHK.PRG 

as such, only commodore-817.prg will be readable on a disk directory with load"$",8


Note that this CAT protocol will work with the FT817 and FT817NR style CAT and not FT450 or 950 models.
